	<h1>Professional Info:</h1>
     <p>I am a former food service professional. I worked as the head service trainer
	 and Top server for Stefano's Trattoria for 10+ years. I enjoy providing people 
	 with things that they need! Due to Covid-19, I have made a dynamic shift in my 
	 professional goals and ambition. I have re-directed and devoted myself to learning
	 more about the art of software development and design. Everything I do now is to 
	 try and learn where these new skills and languages are leading me in order to be of
	 maximum benefit to God and my fellow humans. Wish me well in my journey to produce
	 a beneficial outcome and help others while providing for my family.</p>

​			2000 - 2010</h2>

			<p>​After the Marine Corps I felt I had a responsibility to pass on my
			knowledge, experience and passion for treating our bodies the right way.
			It was the best way for me to give back what I had received from them by
			way of encouragement and teaching. It was a great experience for me to grow.</p>

			about the Web, Internet and the world of writing code in order to build things that can be

					distance from the north or south 
					point of the horizon to the point at which a vertical circle passing through the object
					intersects the horizon.</p>
