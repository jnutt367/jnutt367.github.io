     <p>I am a former Marine and service professional. My passions are
	 my faith and creative individuality as well as being part of great 
	 communities that promote positivity and improving social health and 
	 wellness. When Covid-19 quarantine began, I made the desiscion to make a drastic,
	  , yet necessary, change in my choice of careers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
       <p>You see, my step-son
	  has a compromised immune system as it is due to autism. I could not, in
	  good conscience, work in an environment that is highly exposed and 
	  has so many inherent dangers involving contamination with this new pandemic
	  on the rise. So, I did what any father would do. I figured it out. I have since been dedicated
	  to accuiring the knowledge and skills that I'll need in order to become a 
	  software developer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm">
       <p>Team Treehouse FEWD is where I started and am still working on the
	  very last project to obtain my first certificate of completion for their curricullum.
	  It's been a very challenging and frustrating journey but Dads don't give up.
	  After next week I will start applying for all sorts of jobs that I am not qualified 
	  for...yet!! Because I know that I can and I will put in the effort and dedication it 
	  takes to learn them, just like I have up until now.</p>
